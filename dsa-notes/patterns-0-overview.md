| Pattern                    | Use Case                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1. Sliding Window          | Subarray/substring problems     |
| 2. Two Pointers            | Sorted arrays, pairs/triplets   |
| 3. Fast & Slow Pointers    | Cycle detection, middle node    |
| 4. Merge Intervals         | Overlapping intervals           |
| 5. Cyclic Sort             | Sorting arrays with known range |
| 6. Linked List Reversal    | Reverse singly linked lists     |
| 7. Tree BFS                | Level order tree traversal      |
| 8. Tree DFS                | Preorder, inorder, postorder    |
| 9. Topological Sort        | Task scheduling in DAGs         |
| 10. Trie                   | Word search, prefix queries     |
| 11. Subsets                | Generate all subsets            |
| 12. Modified Binary Search | Search rotated/special arrays   |
| 13. Bit Manipulation       | Use bits for optimization       |
| 14. Backtracking           | Permutations, combinations      |
| 15. Dynamic Programming    | Overlapping subproblems         |
| 16. Graph BFS / DFS        | Graph traversal/search          |
